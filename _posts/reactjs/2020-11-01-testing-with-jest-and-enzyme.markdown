Jest is javascript library to test and Enzyme is React. In this introduction, I'll review 
why test driven development, then I explain some examples of testing with jest and enzime.

## Introduction

First, why Test Driven Development (TDD)? if the requirements are so clear that it 
will be a piece of cake to implement them in a week. Good 
question, why? 

    The 3 TDD Rules of uncle bob,
        - You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
        - You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
        - You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
        
As a programmer for more than 10 years, my answer is simple 
as I understand that you must always expect the unexpected.

Definitely, it's no waste of time, I hardly learned that any effort
to develop better code is a saving in both money and team spirit. 
I mean rework is exhausting for team and obviously reduces profits.

I really love clean code. In fact, I'm a hunter of good practices 
for a pretty tidy well-architected piece of code. However, what about when
your code is thrown to a pack of wolves in the wild-wild-wild internet, 
that are what the scars you gain when the experience runs over with 
your talent.

But the scars are not enough. You need discipline, strictness, and command 
to fight against your own child that wants to play first then test. So far, 
hear the uncle Bob, do yourself a good deed, write a unit test first!

of the Uncle Bob. 

Hopefully, I guess enough to state as clear the cristal how much important 
is that TDD rules your coding.
